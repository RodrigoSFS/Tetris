This is a Tetris game made only with the Java programming language, utilizing the NetBeans IDE in order to make the visual aspect.

The game starts with zero points and with certain velocity, each 3 points make the level up, and each level up the game gets faster.

Controls: The arrow keys.
UP = change where the Tetris block faces.
LEFT = moves the Tetris block to the right.
RIGHT = moves the Tetris block to the right.
DOWN = moves the Tetris instantly to the bottom.
(Hint: It's possible to make the ultra instinct "T-Spin" technique)

I'm clearly not the best on that game.
